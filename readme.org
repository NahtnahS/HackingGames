* BIO
- CTF junkies
- Worked for Raytheon SI
- Quit and founded Vector 35 to do "CTF stuff"

* Is this talk for you?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
- Did you played Pwn Adventure 3 during Ghost in the Shellcode this year?
- Have you ever played a CTF before?
- Have you heard of CTFs before?
- Have you played or hacked a video game?
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Raise your hands and keep them up if any of the following apply to you.
If you still have your hand down, just go ahead and leave now, you're probably not going to like this talk.

- Download the client for your platform (GPU recommended)
- We'll hop online for a demo later on

* Motivation
#+BEGIN_NOTES
First, a brief note on the motivation for the talk. We're really talking about
the growth of both CTFs and gaming together, and how they're related. So first,
gaming.

* Game Industry Profits

#+BEGIN_NOTES
	Here comes the obligatory "Stuff over time" graphs. In this case, money,
	specifically annual revenue of the video game industry. It's a $90B (or
	maybe more depending on who's doing the counting) industry, and is only
	expected to grow.

* Hacking (in?) the Game Industry
- As old as the game industry itself
- Led to the rise of the demo scene, cracking, trainers, etc
[[./images/sanderfocus_animation.gif]]

** Notable Examples
- BNET.D (interop)
- Glider (interop)
- Diablo 3 Auction House (vuln)
[[./images/blizzard.jpg]]

** Code-Signing 
- Game platforms as early bellwethers

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Discussion of how early video game platforms had incentive for strong DRM and
were some of the first to implement code-signing. The hacks from those days
(stealing code-signed objects and repurposing them, for example) remain relevant
today. Instead of a save game file and video game, it's a signed kernel module
with a bug for a priv-esc.

* Growth of CTFs

Likewise, there's an interesting parallel trend in the CTF world as well. Not
are CTFs taking off in popularity, but (as Chris Eagle discussed here two years
ago, there's increasingly real-world spill-over between them.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Interesting to note that in real CTFs, people usually don't look to the real
libraries initially since it would typically make the events take up too much
time -- or at least, if we always were investigating things it would.

                                                          The FreeBSD Project

Topic:          Buffer overflow in handling of UNIX socket addresses

Category:       core
Module:         kern
Announced:      2011-09-28
Credits:        Mateusz Guzik
Affects:        All supported versions of FreeBSD.

[...]

II.  Problem Description

When a UNIX-domain socket is attached to a location using the bind(2)
system call, the length of the provided path is not validated.  Later,
when this address was returned via other system calls, it is copied into
a fixed-length buffer.

Linux uses a larger socket address structure for UNIX-domain sockets
than FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD's linux emulation code did not translate
UNIX-domain socket addresses into the correct size of structure.

Want someone to build a free IDA loader for you if one doesn't exist for the
platform you're working on? Just release a CTF challenge on it, and someone will
publish it!  Somewhat kidding about this, but it has happened multiple times. I
know multiple people who've released challenges specifically for that, and even
as recently as a few months ago, a Nintendo 3DSX loader for IDA was created
specifically because of a CTF challenge.

You hold in your hands a map to a vast treasure under the mountain.  Your
desire to be rich far outweighs your desire to cooperate with others, so
you are obviously going on this quest alone, with only your wits and your
awesome hacker magic to aid you.

You start your quest on a road just outside of town.

You feel a strange forboding feeling eminating from the map, like it has
an alien magic all of its own.

What do you do?
1) Follow the road toward the mountain.
2) Turn around and ask the mage in town what is going on.
